# hello-world
my first repository
Ok, this is my first repository. I am a data science to be. I have a background in science, I have PhD in Biochemistry and a couple of scientific papers published on peer-reviewed journals.
I have quiet some expertise in statistics mainly working with menu-based softwares (ie. SPSS). Right now I am learning to work both with Python and R since I think that programming languages have a lot of potential in data analysis on one hand because they are extremelly versatile and powerfull and on the other hand because the scripts generated can be easily integrated as microservices into complex platforms.
